# ZenUI Template Submission Guide

Welcome to the ZenUI Library! This README will guide you through the process of submitting and selling your templates on ZenUI. By submitting your React, Next.js, or Tailwind CSS templates here, (you can submit any type of website) you can earn **80% commission on each sale** and reach a growing community of developers and businesses.

## Template Requirements

Before submitting your template, ensure it meets the following requirements:

1. **Code Quality**:
    - The code should be **clean**, **well-organized**, and **fully functional**.
    - Use best practices in **React, Next.js, or Tailwind CSS**.
    - Avoid any hardcoded values; use variables or props wherever applicable for maximum customization.

2. **Documentation**:
    - Include a `README.md` file with **clear instructions** on setting up and customizing the template.
    - Describe any third-party libraries used and how they are integrated into the template.

3. **File Structure**:
    - Structure files logically to ensure easy navigation and modification.
    - Bundle all code, assets, and the README file into a **single ZIP file** for easy submission.


## Submission Process

Follow these steps to submit your template to ZenUI Library:

1. **Prepare Your Files**:
    - Create a single **ZIP file** that includes:
        - All code files for the template.
        - Any assets, images, or other resources required.
        - A `README.md` file with setup instructions, customization options, and any additional notes.

2. **Documentation Checklist**:
    - **Setup Instructions**: Provide a clear guide on how to install dependencies, set up the development environment, and start the project.
    - **Customization Guide**: Describe any configurable options or sections that users can modify.
    - **Known Issues/Limitations**: If there are any known limitations or specific requirements, include them here.

3. **Submit the Template**:
    - Email your ZIP file to the ZenUI Library submissions team at **[zenuilibrary@gmail.com]** with the subject line: **[Template Submission - Your Template Name]**.
    - In the email body, include:
        - Template Name
        - Template Description
        - Suggested Price (optional)
        - Your Contact Information (full name, preferred payout method)

4. **Review Process**:
    - The ZenUI team will review your template within **3-5 business days**.
    - You will be notified by email if the template is approved, or if changes are required before publication.

## Earnings & Sales Tracking

Once your template is published on ZenUI, youâ€™ll receive **80% of each sale**. Hereâ€™s how you can keep track of your earnings:

1. **Email Notifications**:
    - Every time your template is sold, you will receive an **email notification** with details of the sale.
    - This allows you to track your sales in real-time.

2. **Calculating Earnings**:
    - To calculate your earnings, multiply the **number of sales** by the **template price**.
    - Example: If your template sells for $20 and you receive 10 sales, your total earnings are $160 (10 sales x $20 x 80%).

## Payout Process

Once your earnings reach **$100 or more**, we will process your payout. We will notify you via email did you want to payout your earning! Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Payout Frequency**:
    - Payouts are processed once you have accrued **$100 or more** in sales.
    - You will receive your earnings via **bank transfer**.

2. **Payout Timing**:
    - Payouts are processed at the end of each month.
    - After reaching the threshold, your funds will be transferred directly to your bank account within **5-7 business days** after processing.

3. **Bank Details**:
    - Please ensure we have your correct bank details on file. Update your information via email if necessary.
